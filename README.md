# deep-long-eclipses
Project &amp; tutorials searching for deep-long-eclipsing systems!

Summer 2022 first-year research project: 
- How many deep-long-eclipses can we find with Gaia DR3 + ZTF?
- Do they all land on the same location on the HR-diagram?
-  ...are they all the same kind of binary-with BIG dusty disks?
